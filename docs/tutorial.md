# Parts required
## Pedalboard
I've included shipping costs as often this is a greater cost than the actual part ordered from AliExpress. You can load an image of the part from the link in description.

Prices will vary, only here as a guide on what to expect.

Notes:
* The dupont cables and breadboard are optional as they are used for testing.
* The TRS sockets must be switched - meaning when you plug the cable in it lifts 1 contact off another. This allows the analog inputs to be grounded when the cable is unplugged (more on this later in the tutorial)
* TRS sockets - you need as many as the number of expression pedals you want to run
* Plastic nuts - it's important not to use metal as they will be used in places that may short a circuit

* Protective glasses
* Allen keys / Screw drivers for screws
* Wire strippers
* Soldering station
* A lot of solder (narrow)...
